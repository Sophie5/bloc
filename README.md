## Installation
- Clone the repo
- `cd` to the project folder
- Run `npm install`
- Run `brew install mongodb` and ensure Mongo is available locally on port 27017
- Create a local MongoDB called `bloc`
- You will need a Facebook App ID and Secret to enable Facebook sign in. This can be set up via Facebook Developers. Create a new app and set the site URL to http://localhost:8080. Create a `.env` file in the root directory including the following:
```
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=[Your facebook app ID]
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=[Your facebook app secret]
```

To test:
- Run `npm test`

To run the application locally:
- Run `node server.js`
- Visit http://localhost:8080/

## Potential feature improvements
* Refactor and test socket-io communication layer
* Refactor client javascript to MVC pattern
* Extract trigonometry to geometry library
* Improve responsiveness of design
